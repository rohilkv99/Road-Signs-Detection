# Road-Signs-Detection
Traffic Sign Recognition Using Convolution Neural Network

# Notes for Code Execution -

First import the kaggle dataset by running the first 5 lines of code and entering the username and key provided.
Now place, 'train.pickle', 'data2.pickle', 'labels.csv' files in the same folder as the '.ipynb' file.
Run the code starting from inputs using Jupyter Notebook.
Do not use colab as RAM usage is high.

# Problem Statement

Traffic Signs are crucial for following proper rules on roads to ensure safety on the road. Self-Driving cars is an upcoming technology in the car industry which requires accurate functioning of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) System. Currently for the Self-Driving technology one of the core technologies is Traffic Sign Recognition(TSR) alongside Advanced Driving Assistant System(ADAS). TSR is also used in all cars launched after 2015 to alert the driver of the speed limit on the road. Road signs are recognised by the camera mounted in front of the car. In Germany, a TSR benchmarking competition is held to support the industrial development.
